# Simulated-Annealing-
This is the code in HTML CSS AND JAVASCIPT to show the usage of the Simulated Annealing 
# defnition
Simulated Annealing (SA) is a probabilistic optimization technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is used to find approximate solutions to optimization problems.
# key idea
It explores the solution space by mimicking the cooling process of metals, gradually reducing the "temperature" to stabilize at a global minimum.
